Welcome to my University Projects Collection! 
This repository houses a compilation of diverse projects that I've worked on during my master in Data Science.

Here's a quick overview of what you can find in this repository:

**ANN for Image classification**: This project served as the culmination of a Statistical Learning course undertaken during my exchange period in Sweden. My teammate and I opted to address a multi-class classification challenge by implementing various neural networks. Specifically, we developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) featuring dropout layers and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our investigation focused on analyzing the patterns of loss and accuracy curves.

**Metropolis-Hastings and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo**: 

**Bayesian Ordinal Probit Regression**
